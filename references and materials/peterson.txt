 First of all, there is in general not possible to observe the flows on all
links in the network. And even if all link flows could indeed be measured, the data
would most likely be neither error-free nor consistent. Secondly, even though correct and error-free link flow data would be available for all links in the network, there are still many OD-matrices which assigned onto the network would induce the observed link flows.
