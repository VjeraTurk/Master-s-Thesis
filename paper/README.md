1. Only LaTex base was installed (as full version is over 5GB), leading later to few packages missing. **Jabref** was also installed, for managing references.

        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base jabref

2. Encoding not set correctly for **Linux**. In TexStudio, under encoding  ...

    2.1. **"Reload With"** each file with **windows-1250** encoding  
    2.2. **"Change To"** ecach file encoding to windows-1250  
    2.3. **"insert Encoding as Tex comment"** in each file  
    2.4 IGNORE (do not uncomment Linux settings) in rithesis_preamble.tex:  
    
    **OR:** (not tested)  
    2.1. Follow 2.1 as above  
    2.2. Follow 2.2 with **UTF-8** instead of windows-1250  
    2.3. Follow 2.3. with **UTF-8** instead of windows-1250  
    2.4  Uncomment Linux settings in rithesis_preamble.tex (comment line for Windows):  

        %%%%%%% adjustment for croatian
        \usepackage[croatian]{babel}
        \usepackage[cp1250]{inputenc}	% this ensures croatian special letters are correctly printed with Windows
        %\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}		% allegedly this will produc Croatian special letter correctly in Linux  



3.  File `enumitem.sty' not found. \setlist (in ritehsis_preamble.tex)

        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
        sudo texhash

    WARNING: It seems
    
        sudo texthash
    is important after LaTeX package installation, otherwise TeXstudio might not open- problematic file seems to be glossaries.sty 

4. Package babel Error: Unknown option `croatian'. Either you misspelled itnd. \ProcessOptions*  
    [solution](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/139700/package-babel-error-unknown-option-francais):
        
        sudo apt-get install texlive-lang-european
        sudo texhash


5. File `tracklang.sty' not found. \@gls@usetranslator  
    [solution](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/254052/new-error-using-glossaries-package-tracklang-sty):

        sudo apt-get install texlive-generic-extra
        sudo texhash

6. 
All Titles from .bib file have forced *lowercase* on all words accept first word in Title. Unable to use Capital letters (are ignored) for example: Boston -> boston
Apparently this is a ["Feature"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/86820/incorrect-case-in-bibtex  
), and can in some cases you can  apparently [overide it in .bst file](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/10775/113519).  
Other solution is to use [{ }](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10772/bibtex-loses-capitals-when-creating-bbl-file  
) around parts of title (or entire title) we wish to keep capitalised.
7.  Force long version of accronyms (for example in chapter or (sub)section title) or other forms of word (e.g. genitive form)
: edit `.glsdef` file by changing value of keys *first* or *text* and use `\glsfirst{}` and `\glstext{}`where you wish to add such forms.

[error](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/328232/what-is-this-mysterious-ecrm1000-missing-file) after adding pdfcomment to riteh_preamble.tex
`sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended` resolves it
